We are growers, hashmakers, and stewards of the land. Our approach focuses on building healthy, living ecosystems beneath our plants, where natural biology thrives. Instead of relying on bottled nutrients or synthetic additives, we nurture our soils with cover crops, compost, and closed-loop regenerative methods that feed the soil, not just the plants. This deep relationship with the land is what gives our resin its unique expression of terroir — and it’s why we believe living soil is the foundation of truly authentic cannabis.",

It was very common to see CBD Isolate priced at $100+ per gram and 500mg CBD Tinctures selling for well over $100 as well.  Due to being involved in the cannabis industry since 2001, I knew the true cost and quality of products offered and realized I could put out a better quality product at half the price by working with true cannabis enthusiasts who had better genetics & extraction methods.  Our three principles are still the same as they were in 2016 – Quality, Affordability & Transparency.",

For two years, they lived like nomads, cruising the West Coast, hitting up over 100 farms and extractors to lock down the best product for their brand. When Delta-8 started buzzing in 2020, they launched Bay Smokes, knowing it’d eventually turn into the cannabis gig they dreamed of. Two years later, they rolled out THCA flower—the real deal they had been waiting for—and now they’re stoked to sling it nationwide, blazing trails in the legal weed scene. Since then, the company has grown to nearly 100 employees and is based in Charlotte, North Carolina.",

At the time I was in college for health sciences, not really enjoying what I was learning and knew that wanted to start a business before I graduated, so that I'd have something established for when I graduated. So, I asked my mom if she would help me get it started, and since she already has a few successful businesses, it would provide me the knowledge and habits to run a successful business. She agreed, fast forward to now and she is still along for the ride! Check out what separates us below!",

The time on the farm was a great experience we will always cherish, and  we hope to return to farming again in 2025.  By May of 2021 we opened our first processing and production facility, where we focused primarily on making joints and blunts for shops and brands nationwide. And by 2022, instead of growing our own flower in Florida, we partnered with an Oregon farm who grows all of our flower for us. As of late 2023 we have opened up our website to individual consumers, giving brand-level quality at wholesale pricing directly to the end customer.",
