At the time I was in college for health sciences, not really enjoying what I was learning and knew that wanted to start a business before I graduated, so that I'd have something established for when I graduated. So, I asked my mom if she would help me get it started, and since she already has a few successful businesses, it would provide me the knowledge and habits to run a successful business. She agreed, fast forward to now and she is still along for the ride! Check out what separates us below!",
